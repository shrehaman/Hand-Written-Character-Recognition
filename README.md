# Hand Written Character Recognition



The Handwritten Character Recognition project focuses on the development of a machine learning model that achieves superior results in recognizing handwritten characters compared to existing models. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and methods to analyze and classify handwritten characters from the popular MNIST dataset. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques, the project aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of character recognition systems.

Key features of the Handwritten Character Recognition project include:

- Dataset selection and preprocessing: The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Preprocessing techniques such as normalization and image enhancement may be applied to enhance the quality of the dataset.
- Feature extraction: The project employs feature extraction methods to extract meaningful information from the raw image data. Techniques such as pixel intensity values, edge detection, or other advanced feature extraction methods can be explored to capture relevant characteristics of the handwritten characters.
- Machine learning algorithms: The project utilizes a range of machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Network to build accurate recognition models. Each algorithm is trained on the labeled MNIST dataset to learn the patterns and characteristics of the handwritten characters.
- Model training and evaluation: The project involves the training of machine learning models using a portion of the MNIST dataset and the evaluation of their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure reliable model evaluation and parameter tuning.
- Ensemble methods: The project explores ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to combine multiple machine learning models and improve the overall recognition accuracy. These methods leverage the diversity of multiple models to reduce errors and enhance the robustness of the recognition system.
- Testing and deployment: The trained models are tested on a separate set of MNIST samples to assess their generalization ability. The best-performing model is selected for deployment and integration into a real-world recognition system. The system can accept input images containing handwritten characters and provide accurate predictions.

The Handwritten Character Recognition project aims to contribute to the field of optical character recognition (OCR) by providing an advanced machine learning model that achieves better results in recognizing handwritten characters. The improved accuracy and robustness of the model can find applications in various domains, including digit recognition, document processing, and automation tasks that involve handwritten inputs.
